        and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether HTML or
        CSS, you can view my previous studying history on LinkedIn. i have also worked on projects like BodaBoda -Banja .I'm quietly
        confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my
        chops one design problem at a time, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch and
